## Overview

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
Starting framing everything through HTML and started to style it through CSS.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Learned the different selectors I needed to apply to the html framework and how different selectors are being used. Was getting a little difficult in terms of what will apply and how to style it correctly.

--proud of this css--
body {
    margin: 0 auto;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

### Continued development

I want to continue on praciticing CSS. Was having difficultiies just knowing what applies to what and how to utilize selectors and classes effectively. Still learning but mostly got the hang of HTML just CSS little bit more of a steeper learning curve.
