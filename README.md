## My process
Starting framing everything through HTML and started to style it through CSS.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Learned the different selectors I needed to apply to the html framework and how different selectors are being used. Was getting a little difficult in terms of what will apply and how to style it correctly.

--proud of this css--
body {
    margin: 0 auto;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

### Continued development

I want to continue on praciticing CSS. Was having difficultiies just knowing what applies to what and how to utilize selectors and classes effectively. Still learning but mostly got the hang of HTML just CSS little bit more of a steeper learning curve.
